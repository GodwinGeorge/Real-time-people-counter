# Real-time-people-counter
Real-time people counter is a system that is able to count while people move through a building or a door. This uses camera and computer vision techniques to complete the task.


In this method, we're not detecting people. We identify the objects in the background and analyze their movement. whether it passes the reference line increment the value of the counter. The disadvantage of this method is, If a cat/ dog or any other object moves and passes the reference line then, it will increment the counter. This project is made in such an assumption that only people are moving objects in certain spaces.
